Gamma dose-rate and flux calculator. Kerma calculated from photons flux using ICRP PUBLICATION 119. For kerma-to-dose conversion used standart ISO 4037-3:2019. For attenuation calculations used data from NIST (https://www.nist.gov/pml/x-ray-mass-attenuation-coefficients).

It is possible to manually input source parameters or to add existing sources to SQLite DB. Also shielding material and type of dose equivalent (ambient or personal) could be choosen.

Also you can perform reverse calculation: estimate required distance for known dose-rate.
